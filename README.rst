AndroidForFun
=============

As part of my new courses of "Paradigms of Programming" in Oxford Brookes University,
I've to develop 7 different programs in 7 different languages.
Two of them will be larger programs (but not too large ;)
and the five others will be smaller, more or less.

Time will tell if the five small programs will be small enough for me
to finish them before the end of the semester :)

AndroidForFun project 
---------------------

So AndroidForFun is one a the 5 small programs :

* No need to explain the name this time :)

Java is one of the languages I've chosen for this module but I didn't want to do a simple
Java project because I'm already used to. On the other hand, I'm pretty new to Android development
and I like this platform.
The idea however was to make a not very useful app, but which will allow me to learn some stuff
like take a picture or retrieve the GPS location of the phone.
This now done with AndroidForFun.
If you don't know about Android development at all, this should be a good beginning for you.

As I said the idea was only to learn how to do, but this will help on another project I have, named DropIt!

New !

AndroidForFun has two more functionalities, it can now take pictures and record videos,
taking advantages of the built-in `Intent` facility and `Media provider`.

This makes it even more simple ! Watch the code sample in the project.

More information on `Intent`s here : http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/intents/intents-filters.html

And on the `Media provider` here : http://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/MediaStore.html 

Enjoy ;)
